Professionally I'm a Software Engineering consultant, which has exposed me to all kinds of systems and software, good (building a fan engagement platform and NFT marketplace for a soccer team) and bad (worst was modernizing a legacy .NET Framework auto loan policy decision engine at a large bank) and everything in-between. Lately, I've been developing internal AI tools to help industry consultants deliver faster.

Outside of software, I enjoy all the outdoor fun the Pacific Northwest has to offer: biking, running, fishing, kayaking, and gaming.
