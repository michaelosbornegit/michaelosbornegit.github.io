[One even helped me build this site how I wanted](https://kgajera.com/blog/display-recent-blog-posts-on-home-page-with-docusaurus/). A couple favs\\n    - [Josh W Comeau](https://www.joshwcomeau.com)\\n    - [unoptimal](https://www.unoptimal.com)\\n- I want the ability to easily share projects I\'ve worked on when geeking out with my buddies\\n- The biggest reason and what finally pushed me over the edge: I want to document my projects and lessons learned for my own future use. Too many times I have made mistakes I have already learned on previous projects, and recently digging through old models trying to remember which tolerances worked best for 3d printing.\\n\\n## HOW\\n\\n[Here](https://github.com/michaelosbornegit/michaelosbornegit.github.io) is the source if you want to poke around or make a site like this yourself.\\n\\n### Docusaurus\\n\\nThis site was created with [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io) a pretty awesome static site generator that allows me to create rich content and save a ton of time\\n\\nI am using some customizations and plugins for docusaurus:\\n- Display recent posts on the homepage using a solution from a docusaurus maintainer [here](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/issues/4138) which was inspired from [this](https://kgajera.com/blog/display-recent-blog-posts-on-home-page-with-docusaurus/) personal blog\\n- [React port](https://github.com/tsukinoko-kun/react-tag-cloud) of [TagCloud.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/TagCloud)\\n- [docusaurus-plugin-image-zoom](https://www.npmjs.com/package/docusaurus-plugin-image-zoom) to use [medium-zoom](https://github.com/francoischalifour/medium-zoom) to be able to click on images and zoom in on them\\n\\n### Hosting\\n\\n- I bought the https://mikeys.world domain off porkbun (HIGHLY recommend porkbun, google domains getting killed was a blessing in disguise) and I\'m using Github pages to host my site\\n- I\'m hosting all of the assets in a google cloud storage bucket\\n\\n### Other\\n\\n- I used [haikai.app](https://app.haikei.app) to generate the svg line art on the homepage\\n\\n## Fun random learnings\\n- When trying to get a video to autoplay (the elf video) I learned that browsers (or at least chrome) block auto-playing videos unless they have are muted. I had no idea browsers stepped in to protect\\nus from the auto-playing max-volume ads of yester-year but I am grateful\\n\\nMuch more to come, but to make this a truly official Mikey project, here\'s my favorite development testing image\\n\\n![a cute dog](https://storage.googleapis.com/website-asset-bucket/puppy.jpg)"}]}}')}}]);
